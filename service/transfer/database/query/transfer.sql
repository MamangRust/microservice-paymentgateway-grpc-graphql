-- GetMonthTransferStatusSuccessCardNumber: Retrieves monthly success metrics for fund transfers
-- Purpose: Analyze successful transfer trends across comparison periods
-- Parameters:
--   $1: card_number  - filter by card_number
--   $2: period1_start - Start date of first comparison period (timestamp)
--   $3: period1_end - End date of first comparison period (timestamp)
--   $4: period2_start - Start date of second comparison period (timestamp)
--   $5: period2_end - End date of second comparison period (timestamp)
-- Returns:
--   year: Year as text (e.g., '2023')
--   month: 3-letter month abbreviation (e.g., 'Jan')
--   total_success: Count of successful transfers
--   total_amount: Sum of successful transfer amounts
-- Business Logic:
--   - Only includes successful transfers (status = 'success')
--   - Covers two customizable time periods for comparison
--   - Zero-fills months with no transfer activity
--   - Formats output for consistent visualization (year as text, month as 'Mon')
--   - Orders by year and month (newest first)
--   - Useful for identifying seasonal transfer patterns and cash flow analysis
