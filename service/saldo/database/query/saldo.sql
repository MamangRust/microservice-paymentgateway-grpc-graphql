-- Returns:
--   The saldo record (existing balance is preserved if already present)
-- Business Logic:
--   - Sets creation and update timestamps automatically
--   - Used when issuing new cards
--   - Atomic idempotency: relies on the partial unique index
--     idx_saldos_card_number_active (card_number WHERE deleted_at IS NULL) so
--     that concurrent creates for the same card (e.g. Kafka card-created event
--     racing with the API create) never produce duplicate active rows.
--   - An existing NON-ZERO balance is preserved (this command is not an
--     administrative balance correction); but a zero balance left behind by the
--     Kafka card-created placeholder event is overwritten so the API create
--     always wins the race against the consumer.

-- Purpose: Used by the Kafka consumer that reacts to card-created events. The event
