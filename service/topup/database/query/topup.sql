-- GetTopups: Retrieves paginated list of active topups with search capability
-- Purpose: Provide admin or user access to topup history with search support
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional filter to match card_number, topup_no, topup_method, or status (NULL for no filter)
--   $2: limit - Max number of records to return
--   $3: offset - Records to skip for pagination
-- Returns:
--   All topup fields and total_count of matching records
-- Business Logic:
--   - Filters out soft-deleted topups (deleted_at IS NULL)
--   - Supports partial, case-insensitive search across multiple fields
--   - Results sorted by topup_time (most recent first)
--   - total_count is used for frontend pagination
