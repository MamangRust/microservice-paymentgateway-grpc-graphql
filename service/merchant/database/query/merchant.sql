-- FindAllTransactions: Retrieves a paginated list of active transactions with optional search
-- Purpose: Display transaction list with merchant info, filtered by card number or payment method
-- Parameters:
--   $1: api-key - The merchant to filter transactions
--   $2: search_query (TEXT, nullable) - Optional search string to match card_number or payment_method
--   $3: limit (INTEGER) - Maximum number of records to return (pagination)
--   $4: offset (INTEGER) - Number of records to skip (pagination)
-- Returns:
--   - transaction_id
--   - card_number
--   - amount
--   - payment_method
--   - merchant_id
--   - merchant_name (from join with merchants table)
--   - transaction_time
--   - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at (for audit purposes)
--   - total_count: Total number of records matching the filter (useful for pagination metadata)
-- Business Logic:
--   - Joins `transactions` with `merchants` to retrieve merchant name
--   - Filters out soft-deleted transactions (where deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
--   - Applies case-insensitive partial match on card_number or payment_method if search query is provided
--   - Uses `COUNT(*) OVER()` to include total matching count for pagination without a separate query
